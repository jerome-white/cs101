There are a few things you should keep in mind:

 o Working with lists is tedious.
 o HTML doesn't care about the ASCII new line character!
 o Brexit negotiations may be called Bregotiations.

Once you have this firmly planted in your brain you can do a few other
things:

 o Learn Spanish
 o Eat more vegetables.
 o Get your submarine drivers license.
 o Make sure you mobile is topped up.

Got it?
