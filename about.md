# Course Information

Title | Introduction to Computer Science
Credits | 4
Prerequisites | None

# Course Description

This course uses programming to introduce students to the various
topics within, and applications of, the field of computer science. By
learning to program, students learn the basics of how computers
actually work, in particular, binary logic and algorithmic problem
solving. Programming is then used to understand fundamental problems
within computer science, such as searching (dictionaries), sorting,
and backtracking. As programming skills are mastered, students are
then able to pursue more advanced topics, such as databases
interaction (SQL) and web programming.
  
# Learning Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

* Understand concepts of programming languages, including data types,
  and flow control

* Understand the procedural and object oriented programming both
  conceptually and practically, and be able to make critical arguments
  about their differences

* Write computer programs using the Python programming language

* Use abstraction to think algorithmically and solve problems
  programmatically

* Present algorithmic and programmatic solutions to their peers

# Teaching and Learning Methods:

There are four primary teaching and learning methods employed in this
course:

1. *Class discussions.* During each class, there will be numerous
   questions posed by the instructor to help students engage in the
   topics and to promote discussion.

2. *Group programming.* Some class discussions will be interactive,
   with the instructor writing portions of a program while the class
   observes, and students writing portions of the program while their
   peers observe.

3. *Individual programming.* Lab sessions will be an opportunity for
   students to master the day's discussion by completing a series of
   small programming assignments. This is a chance to get help from
   the instructor and to discuss topics with peers.

4. *Final project.* A final project will force students to display a
   solid grasp of all concepts covered during the semester. Students
   are required to develop algorithms to solve a chosen problem, map
   those algorithms to computer code, and present the final outcome to
   a large audience.

# Course Materials

Required course texts:

* Gaddis, "[Starting out with Python](http://a.co/gRUWDzB)"

Recommended readings

* Downey, "[Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer
  Scientist](http://a.co/8vb7L9e)"

* Donaldson, "[Python: Visual QuickStart Guide](http://a.co/4j2VKvK)"

Other learning resources

* Students are required to posses a laptop, and that laptop should be
  brought to class daily.

# Assignments and Grades:

The final grade will consist of the following:

Activity | Percentage | Description
--- | --- | ---
Labs | 10% | Each lecture will be followed by a series of programming assignments to solidify the concepts discussed. Assignments will first be attempted individually or in small groups, then discussed and reimplemented together as a class. During a small number of labs, students will be assessed using written evaluation.
Homework | 20% | There will be two to three assignments given throughout the semester. Such assignments require a significant amount of time outside of class.
Project | 20% | A computer program defined and implemented by groups of students. These projects will be presented during the registrar-scheduled final exam period. Further details will be provided near week 12.
Exams | 50% | There will be three written exams throughout the course of the semester; laptops are neither required, nor allowed. Exam 3 will take place during the last scheduled class of the semester, generally scheduled on or the before university-announced final day of semester.
