## Main Event


### <a name="zoo"></a>1. SQL Zoo
SQL Zoo is a popular website for learning and practicing SQL. The site
features several tutorials covering various SQL concepts; today we
will do a subset. First, go to the [SQL Zoo main
page](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Main_Page). Ideally, you should attempt
all of the sections, but what you should focus on today are tutorials
0 and 2, along with 6 and 7. In each, attempt the first 10 questions.

When you click on a section, you will be taken to a page with sets of
queries, instructions, and an interactive terminal where you can
"submit" your SQL. Use this web interface to get the queries right.

#### What to Submit

Once you have completed a tutorial, save/print the page to PDF. Submit
the (PDF) files to NYU Classes. If you are unable to generate PDF
files for any reason, a text file containing the SQL statements you
wrote will suffice.
