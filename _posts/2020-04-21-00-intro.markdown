## Main Event


### <a name="welcome"></a>1. Welcome to Intro!
Please familiarise yourself with the course
[syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus), as well as the following
articles that will serve as Zen-like guidance:

* Cheating is rampant in computer science education. You should try to
  avoid it at all costs: "[As Computer Coding Classes Swell, So Does
  Cheating](https://nyti.ms/2rhn6r2)"

* Although you should bring laptops to class, they should only be used
  for the lab: "[Leave Your Laptops at the Door to My
  Classroom](https://nyti.ms/2jC3xWF)"

* Learning to program is like learning any other language, or even any
  other skill: it requires focus: "[Is the economy suffering from the
  crisis of
  attention?](https://bankunderground.co.uk/2017/11/24/is-the-economy-suffering-from-the-crisis-of-attention/)"


### <a name="anaconda"></a>2. Anaconda installation
In this class you will write lots and lots of programs in Python. Once
you write a program in Python you need another program to actually
interpret and execute it. There are several programs that provide this
functionality; the one we will use is Anaconda.

Python comes in two *flavours*: the 2-series and the 3-series. We will
be using the 3-series. To this end, please [download and
install](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) the Anaconda distribution
corresponding to Python 3. You should most likely use the "graphical
installer," unless you absolutely know what you're doing.
